# Senior Project: R<sub>50</sub> Estimation and Comparison

## Background
In the Air Force, the movement generated by wind farms makes target detection through radar difficult. Some of these radars are designed to report only if a target has been detected or not. Many studies are designed to identify impact of detection capability on radar targeting systems. This project will be focusing on the impact of wind turbine movement on the statistic R<sub>50</sub>, which is defined as the range at which 50% of the target opportunities will be detected.

## Project Goals
1.	Develop a model for estimating R<sub>50</sub>.
2.	Identify impact of target conditions on R<sub>50</sub> and estimating impact by formally comparing the R<sub>50</sub> under different test conditions.
3.	Develop a means of estimating power and confidence for test resourcing and precision capability.
